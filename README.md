# Classmate App
This is another project from my python bootcamp where I build a graphical user interface (GUI) in an object orientated programming
style. As a data source I work with a MySQL database. The focus of the lectures was on learning how to program in oop and 
work with server-side databases. 

## How to work with this repository
1. Make sure you have the latest Python version. I worked with 3.12.
1. Open Project: `cd myproject`
1. Install venv: `python3 -m venv venv`
1. Run venv: `source venv/bin/activate`
2. Install the requirements `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
1. Install and set it up: `MySQL `
2. Connect your main file with the database: `pip install mysql-connector-python`
